While doing this workshop I attended the class and watched recording and some YouTube videos, course notes to make myself strong in the concepts have also referred w3schools,

While doing this workshop I learned to design and code a class template, to template a class variable ,to specialize a templated class variable for a particular type, to instantiate a template class, to specialize a member function of a templated class to process a particular type and finally to  derive a templated class from another templated class.

Starting with templates
------------------------

It is a feature in the c++ which allows functions and classes to operate with the generic types ,it also allows functions to work on other data types without being called or re written even single time.

The function template acts like a except which the template has the arguments of many more types.

The Class template provides a specification for generating the classes based on the parameters,
 These are some of my learnings while doing this workshop.
